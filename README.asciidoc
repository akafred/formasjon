=========

The set up of my virtual private server (VPS). The goal is to automate configuration of everything on the server, while keeping it up and secure.

The virtual server
------------------

The virtual server is delivered with a pretty minimal Debian stable/jessie (initially Debian 8.3), and can be accessed using ssh.


Tools used
----------

* https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/[Vagrant] and https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox] - installed on my Mac using http://brew.sh/[Homebrew]


Development and staging VMs
---------------------------


To reduce the risk of making changes I use two local virtual machines (VMs running in VirtualBox). These are set up using Vagrant; see link:provision/Vagrantfile[the Vagrantfile] for details:

* `devmain` - I poke around in this one manually
* `localmain` - I use this for staging to make sure my automation works as it should. 

The installations of Debian in these VMs differ a little in the packages installed (they have more than the VPS), I'll guess I'll figure out how to handle that as I go along.
